Analysis and Design of Algorithm (CS 402)
Assignment 2

Q.1 Differentiate between Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithm for finding minimum spanning tree. Explain it with example.
Q.2Suppose the letters a, b, c, d, e, f have frequency 43, 13, 12, 16, 9, 5 respectively. What is the average length of Huffman coding?
Q.3 Obtain Huffman’s encoding for the following data:
        a:22 , b: 5,  c:11, d:19,  e:2,  f:11,  g:25,  h:5
Q.3 Find an optimal binary merge tree (pattern) for ten files whose lengths are:
         28, 32, 12, 5, 84, 53, 91, 35, 3 and 11. Also find its weighted external path length.
